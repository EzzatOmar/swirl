;; Hey, welcome to Swirl!

;; You can type ClojureScript code here and it 
;; will be immediately compiled and evaluated in 
;; your browser.

;; Changes to this document are immediately 
;; synchronized with every other browser viewing 
;; this website. Try opening up two browser windows!

;; Now try uncommenting the following line and 
;; changing the color string around:

;; (set! js/document.body.style.backgroundColor "#c0ffee")

;; If you want to type without immediately 
;; seeing changes, toggle autoeval by hitting 
;; the yellow button.

;; You can also force evaluation at any time by 
;; hitting the pink button.

;; The white bar at the bottom of the screen shows 
;; the evaluation result.

;; Try uncommenting the following line and looking 
;; at the result bar:

;; (repeat 200 "hey")

;; Some of the output is probably cut off on 
;; your screen. You can scroll on the result 
;; bar, or you can click on it to make it larger.

;; The width of the editor is also adjustable by 
;; clicking and dragging the divider between it 
;; and the left panel.

;; Here's some clojurescript that will generate a 
;; random color:

;; (.toString (rand-int 16rFFFFFF) 16)

;; Try using that in place of the hardcoded color 
;; above. Now if you can give yourself and others 
;; a light show while you type.
